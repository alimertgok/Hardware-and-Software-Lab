This project consists of implementing an Access Control System that allows controlling access to restrict zones by means of a
User Identification Number (UIN) and a Personal Identification Number (PIN). The system shall allow access to the restrict zone
after the correct input of a UIN and PIN pair. After a valid access, the system allows the delivery of a text message addressed to
the user.
The Access Control System is composed of: a 12-key keypad; a Liquid Cristal Display (LCD) with two lines and 16 columns; a
mechanism for opening and closing the door (referred to as Door Mechanism); a maintenance key (referred to as M) which
defines whether the system is in Maintenance Mode; and a Personal Computer (PC) responsible for controlling the other
components and managing the system.
